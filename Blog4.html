                        Hi Everyone,<br><br>
                        We focused this week on making a connection from the SolarProx application to the Proxmox Server that is running. We were able to meet with our client this week to look over some of the server-side Proxmox settings that were enabled so that we could replicate them on our own machine. We were not able to achieve full data retrival, however we were able to cause response errors and bring back null system information. This was still progress because there was atleast a small connection and we recieved back the errors and null values from the server. We belive that server authentication and session keys may be the cause of these issues. We also took some time this week to lay out some of the classes and methods that will be used across the entire application.  
                        <br><br>
                        Sincerely,<br>
