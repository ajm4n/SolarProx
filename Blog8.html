                        Hi Everyone,<br><br>
                        After a brief meeting with our client, we decided to pursue the PHP version of our site. There were a few key factors that lead us to make this decision. Our client is familiar with php and this will provide easier troubleshooting and understanding for future development. The PHP version is curently functional and meets the required high priority features. Moving forward, the team can work to stabilize the site and work through some of the lower priority feautres. In this week were able to acieve full authentication that is controlled by an active directory server on the network. We were also able to implement sessions to prevent users from viewing pages they are not suppose to. We were able to make some small amounts of progress towards implementing a way for students to submit flag values and recieve points credited to their account. These points along with a list of completed boxes will be shown on the newly implemented profile page. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sincerely,<br>
