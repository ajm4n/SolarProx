                        Hi Everyone,<br><br>
                        This week we invited members of our clients current network security class to run security testing against the site. While we were making progress on additional features, we decided that it was best for us to focus on securing the parts of the application that were top priority. The group of penetration testers were working aginst an older version of the software. After we make a few more changes, we will have them run through a new penetration test to validate that all changes were made and no new vulnerabilites have been created. During this week we were also able to submit our rough draft User Manual and make correction to create a final copy. Our revised User Manual will be avalible at the bottom of the page. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sincerely,<br>
                        ~The Force Of Mercury Team
